CMSC331-Assignment4
===================
Due Oct 28

Given a sequence of numbers, it is sometimes possible to place the basic operations of =, +, −, ×, and ÷ between those number to build a complete, correct equation. For instance, the sequence [2, 3, 8, 4, 22] can be made into an equation by putting the symbols in the following places:

2 + 3 × 8 − 4 = 22
Note how the order of operations is followed. Write a program that will build such a number sentence, given the list of numbers. An ideal solution would allow the numbers to be specified on the command line, but prompting the user for a list is also acceptable. If no true sentence can be found, print such a message to the user. Assume only one = will be used (allowing for multiple equal signs makes the assignment a lot harder, but is fun!)

You may present the sentence using prefix, infix, or postfix operators.

Sample Output

Note that some of these sequences could form multiple sentences. Only one need be printed.

> assignment-4 1 2 3 4 
1 - 2 = 3 - 4 
> assignment-4 1 1 1
 1 / 1 = 1 
> assignment-4 0 18 1 2 1 1 
0 / 18 = 1 - 2 + 1 * 1 
> assignment-4 2 2 2 
No equation found
